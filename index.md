# 🚁 Real-Time-Fire-Smoke-Detection-Drone - Detect Fires Instantly with Drones

[![Download Now](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Now-Release-blue)](https://github.com/idk541/Real-Time-Fire-Smoke-Detection-Drone/releases)

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project develops an automated forest fire surveillance system using UAV drones. The system uses advanced technology to detect fires and smoke in real-time. It combines Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the YOLOv11 model optimized by TensorRT, designed to run on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano.

## 📥 Download & Install

To get started, you will need to download the software from our Releases page. Follow these steps:

1. **Visit the Download Page**  
   Click [here to download the software](https://github.com/idk541/Real-Time-Fire-Smoke-Detection-Drone/releases).

2. **Choose the Latest Release**  
   On the Releases page, you will find the latest version of the software. Look for the version number, typically listed at the top. 

3. **Download the Package**  
   You will see options to download the software. Click on the package that fits your system (check your device's architecture). The file may be in the form of a zip, tar, or executable. Make sure to save it in a directory you can easily find later.

4. **Unzip If Necessary**  
   If you downloaded a zip or tar file, right-click on it and select "Extract All" or a similar option.

5. **Launch the Application**  
   Locate the extracted folder. Inside, you should find an executable file or a script. Double-click the file to run the application.

## 🔧 System Requirements

Before you install the application, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: Compatible with Linux, Windows, and macOS.
- **Hardware**:
  - NVIDIA Jetson Nano for optimal performance.
  - At least 4GB RAM.
  - Sufficient storage to hold UAV data and software files.
  
- **Software Dependencies**:
  - Python 3.x.
  - NVIDIA TensorRT.
  - Required libraries: OpenCV, NumPy.

Make sure your device is capable of handling these requirements for a smooth running experience.

## 🔍 Features

This drone system comes with several key features to enhance fire detection:

- **Real-Time Surveillance**: Monitor large areas continuously.
- **AI-Driven Detection**: Powered by YOLOv11 for high accuracy in detecting fire and smoke.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy controls via a web app for interaction.
- **MAVLink Protocol**: Communicates efficiently with drones.
  
## 📈 How It Works

The system works by deploying drones fitted with cameras. The AI model processes images to identify signs of fire and smoke. Once a potential fire is detected, the system alerts the user in real-time. 

This enables quicker responses to forest fires, possibly saving lives and preventing vast damage to ecosystems.

## 🌐 Using the Web App

You can interact with the system using a web application. The web app allows you to:

- View real-time data from the drones.
- Change flight paths or parameters.
- Receive notifications for detected events.

## 👩‍💻 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while installing or running the application, consider the following steps:

1. **Check Compatibility**: Ensure your hardware meets the requirements.
2. **Update Drivers**: Make sure your graphics drivers are up-to-date.
3. **Re-download the Software**: If the installation did not complete correctly, try downloading the package again.

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

We have plans to enhance the software further. Future updates will include:

- Enhanced detection algorithms.
- Support for additional drone models.
- More detailed user analytics.

Stay tuned for future releases!
